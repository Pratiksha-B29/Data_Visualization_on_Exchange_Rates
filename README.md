# Data Visualization on Exchange Rates

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing exchange rate trends, particularly the Euro-Dollar exchange rate. Using historical data, weâ€™ll explore how global events such as the 2007-2008 financial crisis, the coronavirus pandemic, and changes in US leadership have impacted currency exchange rates. We will also utilize various data cleaning techniques and apply a rolling mean to smooth out short-term fluctuations, allowing us to focus on long-term trends.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical exchange rates between the Euro and the US Dollar, spanning several decades. It includes daily exchange rates which will be cleaned and processed for analysis.

## Steps Involved

**1. Introducing the Dataset:**

- Overview of the dataset, including the time period covered and the source.

- Initial exploration of data features like date and exchange rate values.

**2. Data Cleaning:**

- Handling missing or incorrect data values.

- Formatting the date column to ensure proper chronological analysis.

- Filtering and preparing the data for visualizations.

**3. Rolling Mean Calculation:**

- Applying a rolling mean to smooth out short-term fluctuations in exchange rates.

- This helps to focus on significant trends over a period of time.

**4. Story Ideas for Visualization:**

**Here are a few stories that the data can help tell:**

 - The Euro-Dollar Rate During the Coronavirus Pandemic:

    - We'll show how the exchange rate changed in 2020 during the pandemic.
  
    - We'll compare this to data from 2016-2019 as a baseline.
  
    - A line plot will be used to visualize the changes.

 - Euro-Dollar Rate During the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis:
  
    - This story will highlight how the exchange rate changed during the financial crisis.

    - We'll compare this with data from 2016 and 2009 to show the recovery trends.

    - A line plot will help illustrate these fluctuations.

- Exchange Rate Trends Under Recent US Presidents:

   - We'll compare how the Euro-Dollar rate shifted during the administrations of George W. Bush (2001-2009), Barack Obama (2009-2017), and Donald Trump (2017-2021).

   - A line plot will be used to track changes across these three presidencies.
 
**5. Storytelling with Data Visualization:**

- The focus will be on using line plots to tell clear and engaging stories from the data.

- Each plot will aim to highlight key events and trends that affected exchange rates over time.
